How to Run:


1) Clone or download the project folder.


2) Open hand.html in a browser (preferably Chrome).

3) Allow webcam access when prompted.


How It Works:

The webcam captures both players' hands.

MediaPipe tracks finger positions and passes landmark data.

The app identifies each playerâ€™s hands (Player 1 on the left, Player 2 on the right).

Game logic calculates the best move, tracks wins, and updates the UI in real time.

Buttons let players request best-move hints or start/stop the game.
